The Dutch Polder Model of [[consensus decision-making|Team Consensus]] derives from the necessity for farming communities to reach unanimous agreement on managing polders, systems of dykes that kept the sea from swamping many different farmlands. Such collaboration was maintained even during times of civil war.

The Polder Model simply means no action can be resolved without full consensus, no matter how long that takes to develop.
