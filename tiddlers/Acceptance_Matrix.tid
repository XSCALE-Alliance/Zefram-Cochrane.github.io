[[Behavior Driven Analysis]] analyzes all [[Features|Feature]] across a single [[Epic]] in terms of key categories of acceptance criteria called [[Themes|Theme]]. Themes are drawn from 

* Architectural elements
* Business rules
* Design personas
* Non-functional requirements. 

The contents of the matrix are nothing more than simple checkmarks. This is to say that a feature has acceptance criteria in a particular category, or it does not.

Even though an Acceptance Matrix is confined to a single Epic, and the matrix is only binary, listing more than a handful of themes can make the practice too onerous to contemplate. In general it's best for stakeholders to list just a handful of key themes each to keep the exercise productive.
