[[Portfolio]]s focused on [[Continuous Adaptation]] and [[Continuous Delivery]] need to order feature sets to maximize [[ROROI]] and product-market fit without [[Portfolio Increment]]s and [[Release Refactoring]]

''Therefore,''

Keep a board laid out as per [[Release Refactoring]] but dispense with bronze/silver/gold distinctions. As each [[Feature Squad]] completes a [[Feature]], the [[Portfolio Squad]] picks the next feature from the top of an epic column that best fits the competencies of that feature squad. If none do, the [[Portfolio Squad]] conducts [[Portfolio Mapping]] to refactor the feature squads according to best adapt them to the combinations of competencies needed to deliver all the "next features".
