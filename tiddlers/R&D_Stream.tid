The ''R&D Stream'' is a [[continuous|Continuous Adaptation]] alternative to [[Hackathon]] and [[20% Time]] methods for developing new products and features. Following a strict set-based [[Simple Design]] method, they enable a [[Portfolio Council]] to dedicate specific competencies to anticipating, solving and mounting [[market challenge]]s. They also provide a way for people who are temporarily disengaged from product definition, delivery or support work to work toward [[Critical Number]]s without being regarded as supernumerary or a cost center.
