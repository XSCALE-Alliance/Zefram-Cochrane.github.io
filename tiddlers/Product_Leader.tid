Like the other [[leader roles|XSCALE Leaders]], and unlike the Scrum [[Product Owner]], this role is a [[Servant Leader]], not a [[Command and Control]] manager. It is only accountable for making decisions when the [[Product Squad]] cannot reach consensus about feature definitions, [[Acceptance Criteria]] and [[Royal Cod]] priorities before the [[Last Responsible Moment]]. 

The product leader is also responsible for answering [[Delivery Squad]] questions about features and stories when the [[Product Squad]] isn't conveniently available.
