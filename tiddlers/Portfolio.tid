A [[holarchy|Holarchy]] of [[squads|Autonomous Squad]] and [[chapters|Chapter]] that generates a set of products and value stream is called a ''Portfolio''. The intent is similar to {{SAFe}} portfolio but its organisation builds on that of a {{Spotify}} or {{Iroquois Confederacy}} tribe. 

Like tribes, XSCALE portfolios are limited in size by the [[Dunbar Number]]. Each portfolio [[continuously adapts|Continuous Adaptation]] its configuration of squads and chapters to its [[release plans|Release Plan]] and business objectives through a [[Portfolio Squad]].
