The XSCALE Alliance is dedicated to the promotion of [[Agile Organization]].

> [[We are uncovering better ways of organizing value streams by doing so and helping others do so.|http://xscalealliance.org]]

The Alliance started with [[Peter Merel]]'s experiences coaching Agile transformations at large organizations in Australia and the US. Now there are a lot of folks getting involved in working this way we're setting up an organization to [[dogfood|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food]] it.

The Alliance is forming itself as an open organization like [[The Linux Foundation|http://www.linuxfoundation.org/]]. Its collateral is based on github and uses a combination of [[Leadership as a Service]], [[Slack|https://xscalealliance.slack.com]] and [[Github Flow|https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/]] to evolve this [[wiki|http://tiddlymap.org]], and upcoming books and courseware. While the community is still taking shape, you can get involved by signing the manifesto on the main alliance site.
