[[Portfolio]]s typically maintain a quarterly planning horizon. This period is called a [[Portfolio Increment]] or PI. {{SAFe}} calls it a Product Increment. PIs may be calendar-synchronized or treated as a sliding window or horizon. Calendar-synchronized PIs generally make it easier to align changes in system behavior with marketing, partner and vendor calendars.
