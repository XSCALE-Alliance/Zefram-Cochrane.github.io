[[Acceptance Criteria]] are required for each [[Feature]] and [[Story]] to respect the normal [[INVEST]] properties and [[Definitions of Done|Definition of Done]]. 

An acceptance criterion generally comes in one of two forms. The first is a simple bullet point statement. In the [[Theme]] of security this might be something like "the channel should be secured with RSA encryption". The second is an expanded version of the first, generally expressed as an automatable [[Gherkin Scenario]].
