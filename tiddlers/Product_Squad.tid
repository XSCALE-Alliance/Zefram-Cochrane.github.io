A Product Squad extends the [[Stream Council]] to form a virtual team made up of all business, technical and design stakeholders necessary to [[design|Simple Design]] and prioritise a [[Value Stream]]. It meets on a regular cadence to apply the XSCALE [[Product Management]] patterns along with {{Lean UX}} to contract the [[Epic Landscape]] down to a well-formed [[Release Plan]] of well-formed [[Feature]]s. It tracks its work in a {{3D Kanban}} with its key quality metric being the number of [[Story Point]]s worth of its stories its [[Feature Squad]]s are able to estimate per week.

The product squad is servant-led by the [[Product Leader]] and/or [[Product Coach]].
