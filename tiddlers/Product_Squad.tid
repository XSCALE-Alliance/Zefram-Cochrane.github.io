A virtual team made up of all business, technical and design authorities necessary to define a [[Product]]. The product squad meets on a regular cadence to apply the [[Product Management]] patterns to contract the [[Epic Landscape]] down to [[Estimated Stories|Estimated Story]]. It tracks its work in a {{Kanban}} with its key metric being the number of [[Story Point]]s worth of its stories its [[Delivery Squad]]s are able to estimate per week.

The product squad is servant-led by the [[Product Leader]] and [[Product Coach]].
