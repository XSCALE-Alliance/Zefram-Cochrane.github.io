Some games are like caving up a pie. If one person gets a bigger piece, another person gets a smaller piece. No matter how you carve it up, if you add up all the differences from the average size of a slice you get a zero sum.

Many business people are under the misapprehension that business is a ZSG. Since there are always unexploited markets and undiscovered technologies this could not be further from the truth. Moreover a ZSG mentality is the surest method known to stop someone winning at a {{Positive Sum Game}}.
