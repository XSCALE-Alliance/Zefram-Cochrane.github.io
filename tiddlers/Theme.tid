In XSCALE a [[Theme]] defines a category of [[Acceptance Criteria]] for some cross-cutting technical, business or user experience aspect of system behavior. 

This is a subtly different definition to the one used in Scrum, where a Theme is simply a collection of Epics that maintain some logical relationship to one another.
