Each [[Portfolio]] is steered by a [[squad|Autonomous Squad]] of [[rotating representatives]] each drawn from a different [[Chapter|Chapter Meeting]]. This squad's primary accountability is to factor and refactor the functional responsibilities of its portfolio's [[squads|Autonomous Squad]] by means of the practice of [[Portfolio Mapping]].

A single [[Portfolio]] may employ several distinct kinds of squad. A common arrangement is to use different kinds of squads for product definition, feature delivery, and DevOps. All together the number of members of a portfolio can be no larger than the [[Dunbar Number]].
