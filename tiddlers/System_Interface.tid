Most of the universe is beyond our control. When we build a system, we're optimistic enough to expect that its behaviors are more or less under the control of its users and the other systems with which it interacts. 

The [[System Interface]] describes the surface of those behaviors. We generally describe it in terms of [[BDD]] [[Acceptance Criteria]].
