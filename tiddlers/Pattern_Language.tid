[[Christopher Alexander]]'s classic work defining a language of design patterns for physical architecture is online [[here|https://archive.org/stream/APatternLanguage/A_Pattern_Language#page/n17/mode/2up]]. Alexander's work inspired the software community to describe the repeating patterns of software architecture in similar terms in [[The Gang Of Four book|https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns]] and its various sequels. The form has been extended here to describe a [[practice pattern language]].
