Pattern languages were first defined and exemplified by {{Christopher Alexander}}'s classic work defiining patterns for physical architecture. It's online [[here|https://archive.org/stream/APatternLanguage/A_Pattern_Language#page/n17/mode/2up]]. 

In the late 1990s Alexander's work inspired the software community to describe commonplace patterns of software design in similar terms in the {{Gang Of Four}} book and its various sequels.
