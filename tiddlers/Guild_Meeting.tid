Guilds are meetings held to maintain alignment between [[Portfolio]]s on crosscutting concerns outside the normal [[chapter|Chapter Meeting]] competencies. As large organisations may be comprised of many interacting portfolios, the guild system enables portfolios to align to the organisation's overall business strategy, market position and technical choices while maintaining their respective autonomy.
