In XSCALE, Product Management uses a pattern language called [[Breadth-first Product Planning]] to structure a cycle of collaborative [[Whole Board Thinking]] that iteratively, contractively reduces [[Business Driver]]s to [[changes in system behaviors|Feature]]. The cycle embodies the [[XSCALE Principles]] in 5 simple [[Practice Pattern|practice pattern language]]s:

# [[Pirate Canvas]] to derive an [[Epic Landscape]] from [[Product Analytics]] and metric [[Critical Number]]s. 
# [[Simple Design]] to use science to formalise and break through [[Solution Constraint]]s until the [[Last Responsible Moment]].
# [[Behavior Mapping]] to derive [[Business Feature]]s from [[Epic Pattern]]s and [[Technical Feature]]s from [[cross cutting concern]]s, and achieve closure by cross-referencing these with [[Theme]]s in an [[Acceptance Matrix]].
# [[Business Bingo]] to determine [[Feature Point]] budgets and [[Royal Cod]] priorities.
# [[Release Refactoring]] to determine the maximum [[Throughput]] feature set that can be delivered by a [[Release Date]].
