There are several problems in the way product roadmaps are usually specified.

* [[Product Owner]]s and their stakeholders frequently may intuition as a superior metric to [[Product Analytics]], but this frequently leads to [[Business Case]]s that don't optimise [[Product-Market Fit]] and thereby products that don't fit the market - no matter how excellent the quality and productivity of [[Delivery Squad]] activities. Such intuition may also give rise to the [[all or nothing anti-pattern]].

* Many delivery groups field projects that duplicate a great deal of analysis and delivery effort simply because their roadmaps and release plans are not normalised to reveal commonalities in project baselines. Such duplications are pure [[Waste]]. Furthermore, many such duplications lead to incompatible services that require subsequent projects to bridge and refactor, constituting still more [[Waste]]. Some larger corporations spend most of their IT budgets on such wastes.

* Many analysts do not think [[Breadth First]], and thereby generate requirements that constitute [[Frame Problems]], [[Half Solutions]] and local maxima in the landscape of business value. This isn't their fault; [[Whole Board Thinking]] isn't commonly taught to analysts and most people don't test their frame of reference frequently enough to prevent these problems.

''Therefore,''

# Convert to ENF
# Quantify assumptions
# Winnow as you go
# Map epic landscape across all product lines
# Inform assumptions via metrics/SME
# determine critical numbers per metric
