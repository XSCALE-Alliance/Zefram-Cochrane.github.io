Invention Squads are a better disciplined alternative to [[Hackathon]] and [[20% Time]] methods for developing new products and features. Following a strict set-based [[Simple Design]] method, they enable a [[Stream Squad]] to dedicate specific competencies to anticipating, solving and mounting [[market challenge]]s. They also provide a way for people who are temporarily disengaged from product definition, delivery or support work to work toward {{Critical Number}}s without being regarded as supernumerary or a cost center.
